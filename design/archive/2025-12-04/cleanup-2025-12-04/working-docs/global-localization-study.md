# Global Localization Study for GMC-O Ontology
## Ensuring Equitable Media Recommendations Across TV5 Monde Markets

**Research Date:** December 4, 2025
**Focus:** Decolonizing media ontology to serve diverse francophone markets without Western bias

---

## Executive Summary

This study analyzes media patterns across four major TV5 Monde market regions to identify local genre concepts, cultural markers, and viewing preferences that don't map to Western/English classification systems. The goal is to create equivalence mappings ensuring the GMC-O ontology-based recommender serves all markets equitably.

**Key Finding:** Francophone cinema exists as distinct regional systems shaped by colonial history, local languages, oral traditions, and cultural resistance movements. A truly decolonized ontology must accommodate:
- Non-Western genre taxonomies (e.g., Kannywood's Islamic moral frameworks)
- Creolization as aesthetic principle (Caribbean)
- Oral storytelling traditions (African cinema)
- Cultural sovereignty markers (Quebec)
- Language plurality within francophone space (300+ Nigerian languages, Vietnamese-French hybridity)

## 1. FRANCOPHONE AFRICA (Senegal, Côte d'Ivoire, DRC)

### 1.1 Regional Media Landscape

**Key Characteristics:**
- Originated in 1960s, resembling European art cinema but funded by French state/industry
- No singular "African cinema" - reflects unique histories, tribal affiliations, languages, ethnicities
- FESPACO (Festival Panafricain du Cinéma et de la Télévision de Ouagadougou) serves as coordination center
- 16° East satellite position is leading TV hotspot for francophone Western/Central Africa
- Coexists with Anglophone Nollywood and Lusophone systems following colonial patterns

**2024 Notable Films:**
- **Dahomey** (Senegal/France/Benin, dir. Mati Diop) - Golden Bear winner, cultural repatriation documentary
- **Black Tea** (Côte d'Ivoire) - Poetic romance with Chinese diaspora themes
- **The Woman with the Knife** (1969, Côte d'Ivoire) - Classic symbolic narrative of cultural heritage reclamation

**Distribution Context:**
- Over 150 films at 2024 FESPACO
- Distinct from Nollywood's commercial model
- Reliance on festival circuit vs. theatrical

### 1.2 Local Genre Concepts Not in Western Systems

| Local Concept | Description | Cultural Context |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Cinéma de Palabre** | "Palaver cinema" - oral storytelling tradition filmed | Based on African oral councils where community gathers to debate/resolve issues through dialogue |
| **Cinéma Griot** | Films structured like griot (storyteller) narratives | Non-linear, episodic, privileging memory and collective history over individual arc |
| **Résistance Culturelle** | Cultural resistance cinema | Films explicitly about reclaiming heritage from colonial erasure (not equivalent to "political thriller") |
| **Cinéma de Rapatriement** | Repatriation cinema | Focuses on return of cultural artifacts, diaspora homecoming, post-colonial reconciliation |
| **Film Tribaliste** | Films exploring specific ethnic group traditions | Not "ethnographic documentary" but insider cultural celebration |

**Language-Specific Aesthetic Concepts:**
- **Wolof "Téranga"** (Senegal): Hospitality as narrative structure and visual aesthetic
- **Lingala "Libanga"** (DRC): Stone/permanence - films about enduring cultural memory
- **Bambara storytelling modes**: Cyclical time, communal protagonist

### 1.3 Genre Equivalence Issues

**Problems with Western Mapping:**

1. **"Documentary" is inadequate** for hybrid oral/visual traditions
   - **Dahomey** mixes documentary, dramatization, spiritual voice-over from artifacts themselves
   - Western ontology: strict documentary/fiction binary
   - African practice: blended forms privileging metaphysical truth over factual recording

2. **"Art Cinema" marginalizes** commercial African films
   - Implies festival-only, not for general audiences
   - Reality: FESPACO films are community events, socially embedded

3. **"Political Film" mischaracterizes** cultural resistance
   - Western frame: oppositional/activist
   - African context: cultural affirmation, not necessarily oppositional

4. **Genre binaries don't accommodate** oral tradition structures
   - Griot narratives mix history, music, poetry, drama
   - No Western equivalent to "oral epic film"

### 1.4 Viewing Patterns & Preferences

**Regional Preferences:**
- Strong preference for films in local languages (Wolof, Bambara, Lingala) over French
- Community viewing contexts (outdoor screenings, post-film discussions)
- Preference for films addressing local social issues (land rights, youth unemployment, religious identity)
- Interest in pan-African collaborations (Senegal-Benin-France co-productions)

**Distribution Channels:**
- DTH satellite (16° East) dominates
- Pay TV operators serve francophone markets
- Mobile-first video consumption growing
- FESPACO and regional festivals as primary discovery mechanism

### 1.5 Cultural Context Markers Unique to Region

**Visual/Aesthetic:**
- **Color symbolism**: White for mourning (contrary to Western black)
- **Framing**: Wide shots emphasizing community over individual
- **Time**: Non-linear, cyclical structures reflecting oral tradition
- **Music**: Integrated as narrative device, not background score

**Narrative:**
- Collective protagonists (family, village, ethnic group)
- Elders as wisdom keepers (not "mentor" trope)
- Spiritual/ancestral presence as active characters
- Proverbs as dialogue structure

**Production Context:**
- French co-production funding shapes content
- Festival circuit validation vs. box office
- Diaspora directors returning to make films
- Tensions between "festival cinema" and popular cinema

---

## 2. QUEBEC AND CANADIAN FRENCH CINEMA

### 2.1 Regional Media Landscape

**Key Characteristics:**
- Distinct from English Canadian cinema due to language and cultural differences
- Successful resistance to Hollywood hegemony - French language films outperform English Canadian films at Quebec box office
- Dual tradition: commercial populist cinema + internationally acclaimed auteur cinema
- 2024: 5 films earned over $1M (Nos Belles-Sœurs: $3.5M)
- Film classification formerly by Régie du cinéma (now Ministry of Culture)

**Current Trends (2024):**
- "Cinéma bienveillant" (cinema of good will/benevolence) with clear moral stances
- Questions of identity, masculinity, ecology rising
- Widening divide between popular and critical cinema
- Francophone horror quietly redefining Canadian cinema

**International Recognition:**
- Denis Villeneuve, Xavier Dolan, Denis Côté gained global audiences (2010s)
- Shift from local history to global concerns (Incendies, Monsieur Lazhar, War Witch)

### 2.2 Local Genre Concepts Not in Western Systems

| Local Concept | Description | Cultural Context |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Cinéma Populaire Québécois** | Quebec popular cinema with folk homogeneity appeal | Distinct from Hollywood populism - rooted in "survivance" (cultural survival) narrative |
| **Film de la Révolution Tranquille** | Films of the Quiet Revolution era | Political/cultural awakening specific to 1960s Quebec (not equivalent to "political drama") |
| **Cinéma Joual** | Films in working-class Montreal dialect | Language itself is cultural resistance (not just "dialect film") |
| **Drame de la Souveraineté** | Sovereignty drama | Identity films about Quebec independence - no English Canadian equivalent |
| **Horreur Francophone** | Francophone horror with distinct aesthetic | Not Anglophone horror - rooted in Catholic imagery, linguistic isolation fears |
| **Télésérie Québécoise** | Quebec television series format | Distinct narrative structures, cultural references not found in France or English Canada |

**Language-Specific Aesthetic Concepts:**
- **"Nordicité"**: Northern identity aesthetic - cold, isolation, resilience
- **"Joual" authenticity**: Working-class Montreal speech as cultural marker
- **"Survivance" narrative**: Cultural survival against assimilation
- **"Terroir" cinema**: Rooted in specific Quebec landscapes/customs

### 2.3 Genre Equivalence Issues

**Problems with Western Mapping:**

1. **"French Cinema" conflates** Quebec and France
   - Quebec films are culturally distinct from French productions
   - Different funding, exhibition, cultural reference systems
   - Language differences (Quebec French vs. European French)

2. **"Regional Cinema" marginalizes** Quebec's cultural sovereignty
   - Quebec cinema is national cinema of a stateless nation
   - Not a "regional variant" of Canadian cinema

3. **"Horror" inadequate** for francophone horror aesthetics
   - Anglophone horror: visceral, explicit
   - Francophone horror: psychological, Catholic imagery, linguistic dread
   - Genre precision lost in translation

4. **"Popular Cinema" vs. "Art Cinema"** binary doesn't work
   - Quebec industry successfully integrates both
   - Commercial films reflect Quebec culture (language, values)
   - Not Hollywood imitation

### 2.4 Viewing Patterns & Preferences

**Regional Preferences:**
- Strong preference for Quebec-produced films over French or English content
- Support for commercial films reflecting Quebec realities, language, culture
- Interest in auteur cinema with local cultural specificity
- Growing francophone horror audience

- Catholic imagery repurposed in horror/drama
- Hockey, winter, rural life as cultural touchstones
- Code-switching between joual and international French

### 2.5 Cultural Context Markers Unique to Region

**Visual/Aesthetic:**
- Winter landscapes as identity marker (nordicité)
- Catholic iconography (churches, crosses, saints)
- Urban Montreal vs. rural Quebec divide
- Architecture reflecting colonial history

**Narrative:**
- Language politics as subplot or theme
- Intergenerational trauma (colonization, church, language)

### 3.2 Local Genre Concepts Not in Western Systems

| Local Concept | Description | Cultural Context |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Cinéma Indochinois** | Films reflecting French Indochina legacy | Hybrid cultural identity, colonial/postcolonial tension |
| **Film du Mékong** | Mekong River basin narratives | Regional identity spanning Vietnam-Cambodia-Laos |
| **Cinéma de la Diaspora Indochinoise** | Films by/about Vietnamese/Cambodian diaspora | Complex relationship to French language and culture |
| **Cinéma Khmer Rouge** | Films about Cambodian genocide | Historical trauma specific to Cambodia (not generic "war film") |
| **Film de Reconstruction** | Post-war/post-genocide reconstruction narratives | Nation-building cinema in postcolonial context |

**Language-Specific Aesthetic Concepts:**
- **Vietnamese "Quê hương"**: Homeland/native place - deep attachment to land
- **Khmer "Bayon" aesthetic**: Smiling faces masking pain (Angkor Wat iconography)
- **"Métissage Culturel"**: Cultural mixing of French, Vietnamese, Chinese influences

### 3.3 Genre Equivalence Issues

**Problems with Western Mapping:**

1. **"Postcolonial Cinema" flattens** diverse experiences
   - Vietnamese vs. Cambodian experiences differ radically
   - French colonialism ≠ American war ≠ Khmer Rouge genocide
   - Each requires distinct ontological categories

2. **"Asian Cinema" erases** francophone specificity

   - Vietnamese films about American War have different perspective than American "Vietnam War films"
   - Generational trauma, not combat narrative

4. **Language plurality ignored**
   - Films may mix French, Vietnamese, Chinese, Khmer

## 5. CROSS-REGIONAL PATTERNS & DECOLONIZATION IMPERATIVES

### 5.1 Common Decolonization Issues

**Western Bias in Current Ontologies:**

1. **Genre Binary Thinking**
   - Western: strict fiction/documentary, art/commercial divides
   - Non-Western: hybrid forms privileging metaphysical truth, oral tradition, collective authorship

2. **Individual Protagonist Assumption**
   - Western: hero's journey, individual character arcs
   - Non-Western: collective protagonists (family, village, community, ancestors)

3. **Linear Narrative Assumption**
   - Western: three-act structure, cause-effect logic
   - Non-Western: cyclical time, oral epic structure, episodic griot narratives

4. **Language Monolingualism**
   - Western ontologies assume single language
   - Francophone contexts: French + local languages (Wolof, Creole, Vietnamese, Joual)
   - Code-switching has cultural/political meaning

5. **Festival vs. Popular Binary**
   - Western framework: art cinema (festivals) vs. commercial (theaters)
   - Reality: FESPACO films are community events; Quebec commercial films reflect culture

6. **Colonial Gaze Persistence**
   - "Ethnographic," "exotic," "folkloric" categories
   - Insider cultural celebration misclassified as outsider documentation

## 7. BIAS MITIGATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### 7.1 Ontology Design Principles

**1. Avoid Colonial Categories**
- Do NOT use: "ethnographic," "folkloric," "exotic," "primitive"
- DO use: insider cultural terms, self-definitions, regional genre names

**2. Accommodate Hybrid Forms**
- Recognize blended documentary/fiction, oral/visual, individual/collective
- Create `gmco:HybridForm` class rather than forcing binary choices

**3. Language Plurality as Default**
- Assume multilingualism, code-switching
- Track language choices as cultural/political statements
- Don't privilege French over local languages (Wolof, Creole, Vietnamese)

**4. Cultural Context as Primary**
- Genre alone insufficient for recommendation
- Require cultural context markers for accurate matching
- User's cultural background should influence recommendations

**5. Decentrer Western Narrative Structures**
- Don't assume linear, three-act, individual protagonist
- Support cyclical, episodic, communal narratives
- Griot structure ≠ "poorly structured"

**6. Festival vs. Popular Binary**
- Quebec commercial films are culturally specific, not Hollywood imitations
- FESPACO films are community events, not elite art cinema only
- Reject "art cinema" as marginalizing label

**7. Production Context Matters**
- French co-production funding shapes content (potential bias)
- Diaspora filmmakers have different relationship to homeland
- Infrastructure limitations (Haiti theaters) affect distribution not quality

### 7.2 Recommendation Algorithm Adjustments

**Bias Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Cultural Context Weighting**
   - Match users to films sharing their cultural context (e.g., Caribbean viewers → Caribbean films)
   - Don't only recommend based on Western genre (e.g., "thriller")
   - Weight cultural markers higher than genre for diverse audiences

2. **Language Preference**
   - Allow users to specify language preferences beyond French
   - Recommend films in local languages (Wolof, Creole, Vietnamese)
   - Don't assume French-only preference

3. **Regional Representation**
   - Ensure all TV5 regions represented in recommendations
   - Monitor for over-representation of French/European films
   - Set diversity quotas if needed

4. **Avoid "Exotic Other" Recommendations**
   - Don't recommend African films to Western viewers as "exotic"
   - Match cultural context, not "difference" appeal
   - Inside cultural celebration ≠ outside curiosity

5. **Hybrid Form Recognition**
   - Don't penalize non-Western narrative structures
   - Griot narratives, creolization, oral tradition are valid forms
   - User preference learning should include structure preferences

6. **Production Year Bias**
   - Don't privilege recent over classic (FESPACO classics important)
   - Infrastructure challenges delay releases (not indicator of quality)

7. **Festival vs. Popular Balance**
   - Don't assume festival films only for "cinephiles"
   - Quebec popular films are culturally valuable
   - Community viewing contexts matter

### 7.3 Metadata Collection Guidelines

**Required Cultural Metadata:**
- Region of production (specific: Senegal, not "Africa")
- Language(s) used, including code-switching
- Cultural context markers (creolization, oral tradition, etc.)
- Narrative structure type (linear, cyclical, griot, etc.)
- Protagonist type (individual, collective, community)
- Production context (co-production, diaspora director, etc.)
- Intended audience (community, festival, commercial)
- Cultural consultants/authenticity

**Avoid Biased Metadata:**
- Don't label as "exotic," "folkloric," "ethnographic"
- Don't assume Western genre categories fit
- Don't use colonial-era terminology
- Don't conflate regions (Africa ≠ monolith)

## 9. IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### 9.1 Ontology Development Priorities

**Phase 1: Core Extensions (Weeks 1-2)**
1. Add NarrativeStructure taxonomy (linear, cyclical, griot, episodic)
2. Add ProtagonistType (individual, collective, community, ancestral)
3. Add LanguageUse classes (monolingual, code-switching, dialect)
4. Add CulturalContext base class

**Phase 2: Regional Genre Mappings (Weeks 3-4)**
1. Implement Francophone Africa classes (25 concepts)
2. Implement Quebec classes (20 concepts)
3. Implement Southeast Asia classes (15 concepts)
4. Implement Caribbean classes (15 concepts)

**Phase 3: Equivalence Assertions (Week 5)**
1. Define `owl:equivalentClass` where appropriate
2. Define `owl:differentFrom` to prevent conflation
3. Define `owl:relatedMatch` for partial overlaps
4. Document reasoning for each assertion

**Phase 4: Cultural Metadata Schema (Week 6)**
1. Create metadata template for each region
2. Train annotators on cultural context
3. Pilot annotate test datasets
4. Refine based on edge cases

### 9.2 Data Collection Workflow

**For Each Film:**
1. **Basic Metadata** (standard): Title, year, director, country, language(s)
2. **Regional Context**: Specific region (Senegal, not "Africa"), cultural communities
3. **Genre Classification**: Western genre + local genre term if applicable
4. **Narrative Structure**: Linear, cyclical, griot, episodic, hybrid
5. **Protagonist Type**: Individual, collective, community, ancestral, mixed
6. **Language Use**: Monolingual, bilingual, code-switching, dialect, which languages
7. **Cultural Context Tags**: 3-5 tags from ontology (creolization, oral tradition, etc.)
8. **Production Context**: Co-production, diaspora director, festival vs. commercial intent
9. **Cultural Consultants**: Were cultural insiders involved in production/classification?
10. **Intended Audience**: Community, festival, general, diaspora

**Quality Control:**
- Regional cultural experts review annotations
- Check for colonial language (flag "exotic," "ethnographic")
- Ensure local genre terms used when applicable
- Validate language assertions (is Creole actually used?)

### 9.3 Recommendation Algorithm Modifications

**User Profile Extensions:**
- Cultural background (self-reported, optional)
- Language preferences (French, Wolof, Creole, Vietnamese, etc.)
- Region familiarity (lived experience, diaspora, curious outsider)
- Narrative structure preferences (linear, cyclical, oral tradition)

**Matching Algorithm Adjustments:**
1. **Cultural Context Boost** (2x weight for matches)
   - User from Senegal → boost Senegalese films, West African films
   - User speaks Haitian Creole → boost Creole language films

2. **Language Preference** (1.5x weight)
   - User prefers local languages → boost Wolof, Creole, Vietnamese
   - Don't assume French-only preference

3. **Narrative Structure Match** (1.3x weight)
   - User likes griot narratives → boost other griot films (not just by genre)
   - User likes linear Hollywood → don't penalize but don't force-match

4. **Regional Diversity Quota**
   - Ensure at least 20% recommendations from non-France regions
   - Rotate regions to avoid ghettoization (not only African films for African users)

5. **Avoid "Exotic Other" Pattern Detection**
   - Flag if Western users only get "exotic" African films
   - Balance insider celebration with curiosity

6. **Production Quality ≠ Infrastructure**
   - Don't penalize Haitian films for lack of theatrical release
   - Quality metrics independent of budget/infrastructure

### 9.4 Evaluation Metrics

**Bias Detection Metrics:**
1. **Regional Representation**: % of recommendations from each region (target: matches TV5 audience distribution)
2. **Language Diversity**: % of non-French language films recommended
3. **Genre Ghettoization**: Do users only get films from their own region?
4. **Western Overweight**: What % from France/Belgium/Switzerland? (should be minority)
5. **Cultural Context Usage**: How often do matches use cultural context vs. genre alone?
6. **Hybrid Form Recognition**: Are griot narratives, creolization films matched correctly?

**Equity Audit:**
- Run test queries for users from each region
- Check if Quebec films labeled correctly (not "French")
- Check if African films get diverse sub-regional classification
- Check if Caribbean Creole language films surfaced
- Check if Southeast Asian films don't get lost in "Asian cinema" mass

**User Feedback:**
- "Was this recommendation culturally relevant to you?"
- "Did this film reflect your cultural context accurately?"
- "Were local languages/dialects used?"
- "Was this a film made for your community or for outsiders?"

## 10. CONCLUSION & NEXT STEPS

### 10.1 Key Takeaways

**The GMC-O ontology must be fundamentally decolonized to serve TV5 Monde's diverse markets equitably.**

**Five Critical Changes:**
1. **Reject Western Genre Binaries** - Accommodate hybrid forms, oral traditions, collective narratives
2. **Center Cultural Context** - Genre alone insufficient; cultural markers primary
3. **Language Plurality Default** - French + local languages, code-switching as norm
4. **Regional Self-Definition** - Use insider terms (griot, créole, joual), not colonial labels
5. **Production Context Awareness** - Infrastructure ≠ quality; co-production funding shapes content

**Bias Mitigation Imperatives:**
- Monitor for France/European over-representation
- Ensure all regions get specific sub-regional classification (Senegal ≠ Mali ≠ DRC)
- Weight cultural context matches higher than genre alone
- Avoid "exotic other" recommendation patterns
- Accommodate non-Western narrative structures without penalty

### 10.2 Next Steps for Development Team

**Immediate Actions (This Week):**
1. Review this study with regional cultural consultants from each area
2. Prioritize ontology extensions (NarrativeStructure, ProtagonistType, LanguageUse)
3. Begin regional genre mapping in Turtle format
4. Recruit cultural annotators from each region for test dataset

**Short-Term (Weeks 2-6):**
1. Implement Phase 1-4 ontology extensions (see 9.1)
2. Annotate test datasets with new cultural metadata
3. Modify recommendation algorithm to use cultural context
4. Run bias detection audit on test queries

**Medium-Term (Months 2-3):**
1. Scale annotation to full TV5 Monde catalog
2. Train ML models on culturally-aware features
3. Deploy beta recommender to regional user groups
4. Collect feedback, iterate

**Long-Term (Months 4+):**
1. Publish decolonized ontology as open standard
2. Share with other francophone media platforms
3. Continuous bias monitoring and regional expansion
4. Academic publication on decolonizing media ontologies

### 10.3 Success Criteria

**The GMC-O-based recommender will be successful when:**
- ✅ Users from all TV5 regions feel culturally seen and served
- ✅ Local genre terms (griot, créole, joual, Mekong) are used and understood
- ✅ Films in local languages (Wolof, Creole, Vietnamese) are surfaced
- ✅ Non-Western narrative structures (cyclical, oral, collective) are matched correctly
- ✅ Regional representation is equitable (not France-dominated)
- ✅ Cultural context drives recommendations, not just genre
- ✅ "Exotic other" patterns are eliminated
- ✅ Quebec films are distinct from French films
- ✅ African cinema has diverse sub-regional classification
- ✅ Caribbean Vodou films aren't classified as horror
- ✅ Cambodian genocide films aren't generic "war films"

**This is not just about better recommendations. This is about epistemic justice - ensuring that non-Western ways of knowing, storytelling, and experiencing cinema are respected and supported by the ontology itself.**
